<p>Estancia Perales, this remote waterside estancia is almost next to the <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_glaciers_of_Chile" target="_blank">Glaciar Serrano</a>, a beautiful
    hanging glacier in the southern part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_del_Paine_National_Park"
                                               target="_blank">Torres del Paine National Park</a>. Dominated by the high
    peaks of the Chacabuco mountain range, some of which are permanently covered in snow and ice and with views of Cerro
    Prat to the rear, this is a very special place and a real contrast to some of the scenery inside the Park.</p>
<p>The estancia welcomes a variety of guests who arrive here either via Zodiac boat from <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Natales" target="_blank">Puerto Natales</a> or those that come on the
    21 de Mayo boat which collects kayakers from further up the Serrano River. The estancia is not only a great place
    for a lamb asado, it also farms cattle and sheep.</p>
